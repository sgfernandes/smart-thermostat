The Continuous Thermostat Setpoint Monitoring and Correction software is a set of fault detection and correction algorithms that can be implemented in thermostats with two-way OpenAPIs. It is written in the Python language. The algorithms aim to detect the most common and impactful efficiency problems associated with thermostat setpoints - overly aggressive heating or cooling setpoints, incorrect schedules/setbacks, and overly narrow deadbands. These algorithms can automatically detect faults, and implement associated corrective actions to bring the system back to a state of efficient operation. The algorithms can run remotely in the cloud, and directly implemented by connected thermostat manufacturers, or by third party service providers. The software enables a lightweight cost-effective energy management strategy for HVAC systems. The solution is specially viable for small and medium sized commercial buildings, where a full scale building automation system and fault detection and diagnostic tools are often unavailable.
